## General information
Lond-ON-Time is a companion application crafted for public transit users, by public transit users with the main purpose of streamlining and upgrading the transit experience in London, Ontario.

Lond-ON-Time provides the main functions you'd expect from a bus tracking application, such as real-time route tracking, descriptive directions, favourite stops and live bus locations.

The application offers a detailed Mapbox map that allows users to view their current location and their surroundings to help them have a better understanding of where to go.

The user has the ability to view the most up-to-date transit arrival times. This allows the user to know the time of arrival for every LTC bus on route so they can get to where they are going.

Lond-ON-Time ensures user satisfaction by offering the ability to save stops that they visit often as a 'Favourite'. This allows the user to have a fast and convenient option to view bus information on the go.

The application ensures users know how to get from point A to point B. It allows users to plan out their trips in advance by entering start and end locations.


## Upcoming features
* Ability to set a weekly schedule to track buses you generally take at the same time throughout the week.
